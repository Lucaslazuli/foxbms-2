# CRC functions

These Jupyter notebooks help to generate the CRC-functions as
fast table implementations that are used by certain monitoring
ICs.

## CRC-1 - 0x48F

For details of the CRC polynomial see [here](./crc-10_0x48f.md).

## CRC-15 - 0xC599

For details of the CRC polynomial see [here](./crc-15_0xc599.md).

## TODO

Make

- `crc8-0xa6.ipynb` and
- `crc16-0x9eb2h.ipynb`

MarkDown files.
